Clustering-image segmentation
In this project, we will explore image segmentation using different clustering algorithms. 

Introduction:
Image segmentation is a sub-domain of computer vision and digital image processing which aims at grouping similar regions or segments of an image under their respective class labels.
Clustering algorithms perform better than their counterparts and can provide reasonably good segments in a small amount of time. Popular algorithms like the K-means clustering algorithms are unsupervised algorithms that work by clustering pixels with common attributes together as belonging to a particular segment. 
K-means clustering, in particular, takes all the pixels into consideration and clusters them into “k” classes. Differing from region-growing methods, clustering-based methods do not need a seed point to start segmenting from.


Proposed content of our website post:
First, we will explain how image segmentation works as well as how clustering algorithms can be applied to this topic. Different clustering algorithms will be adopted, including k-means, mean-shift, Fuzzy clustering or any other potential algorithms. Applications will be demonstrated through various datasets, for example, COVID-19 X-Ray data, Stanford Dogs data, etc. A shiny app can be developed to allow for interactions on parameter tuning or self-uploaded image processing (if time allows). Performances of different clustering algorithms will also be compared and key takeaways will be summarised.
